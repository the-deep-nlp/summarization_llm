"Current needs include WASH, shelter, health, and food assistance in addition to rescue and rubble removal equipment’s, medical kits, and kitchen sets.
The numbers of people remaining in temporary shelters in their village and those displaced to other villages or provinces are unclear. The earthquake has affected about 100,000 children across all affected areas, who likely need protection assistance.
The lack of temporary collective shelter solutions is leading to overcrowding or to households sleeping in open air, exposing them to public health risks as well as safety and security threats, including SGBVs
The earthquake has heightened vulnerabilities, particularly among children, with school closures exposing them to exploitation risks. Women, boys, girls, and unaccompanied minors face increased dangers in disrupted communal spaces. Needs include secure shelters, child protection measures, restored educational facilities, targeted strategies for vulnerable groups, and psychosocial support.

With the support of the World Bank, underlines the Fitch expert, the Moroccan government has also set up a  social protection system to compensate uninsured people via a national solidarity fund. The fund is estimated to pay out about $600 million in the event of an earthquake occurring every 100 years, Fitch Rating analyst said.
Search teams from Spain, Britain and Qatar joined Moroccan efforts to find survivors from the 6.8 magnitude quake that struck in the High Atlas Mountains late on Friday, flattening the traditional mud brick houses ubiquitous in the region.
The army said it was reinforcing search-and-rescue teams, providing drinking water, and distributing food, tents and blankets.
In the hamlet of Tarouiste it was a similar story. Of the 12 houses that were once there, not a single one was left standing. Even ambulances had not reached it yet. The dead bodies of six people were dug out by neighbours and carried down the mountain to where cars could take them to hospital.
Footage shared by the Moroccan government on social media showed soldiers digging frantically among towering piles of rubble and using dogs in the faint hope of finding any remaining survivors, as bodies shrouded in blankets were lined up nearby.
“The villagers helped dig through the rubble and search for survivors,” said Mustapha Abbou, a volunteer aid worker from the region who was in the village of Azgour. “Right now, the areas that remain hardest to reach are the rural communities of Ijoukak, Ighil and Aghbar, close to the epicentre of the earthquake. Some aid has reached the town of Ijoukak, but the area also includes smaller hamlets further up in the mountains. If we can’t get there by car, we will take food supplies up there using motorbikes or donkeys.”
“The situation is catastrophic, many houses completely crumbled. As these were homes largely made of mud bricks, when they collapsed they also buried entombed people, which also makes the possibility of finding people alive more difficult. There are many dead, but it is very difficult to evaluate the number of them.” [Omar Saadoune, a civil society activist, speaking from Casablanca]
Rescue personnel from the armed forces and civil defense personnel participate in these operations, working in full swing to search for survivors, rescue them from under the rubble, and provide the necessary medical care to the injured.
Members of the Royal Armed Forces arrived at the site and began excavation work to recover the bodies of presumed victims from under the rubble, according to local residents, in the presence of members of the Royal Gendarmerie, before the Le360 website correspondent came across ambulances and other vehicles carrying members of the National Security on board to support the efforts being made.
The Moroccan authorities are still racing against time to rescue citizens trapped under the rubble, and to provide relief and shelter to those affected by the earthquake that shook Morocco a few days ago, causing heavy human and material losses. Yesterday evening, Sunday, trucks loaded with aid set off from various regions of the Kingdom in the direction of the stricken districts of Al Haouz.
Search and rescue teams from Spain, the UK, and Qatar are currently working alongside Moroccan relief teams in the affected areas.
Since the disaster hit on Friday night, Moroccan Red Crescent teams have been working with Moroccan authorities. They are supporting search and rescue operations, providing first aid and psychosocial support, helping transport the injured to hospitals and evacuating people from damaged buildings, and providing food and water.
Since the first hours of the earthquake, the public authorities used military helicopters to reach those affected in the rugged mountainous areas besieged by falling rocks and stones.
Government officials are taking the lead in responding to the crisis and providing crucial aid and assistance to those affected by this tragic event. The primary reported needs are food, water, psychosocial support, and shelter. Due to the extensive damage caused by the earthquake, many people have been displaced from their homes and are seeking refuge in public facilities, often resorting to sleeping outdoors.","The earthquake in Morocco has caused significant damage and has affected about 100,000 children who are in need of protection assistance.

Despite the difficulties, Caritas Morocco continues to provide aid to the population in the town of Amizmiz, one of the areas most affected by the earthquake, and in some villages in the surrounding mountainous area. People are receiving basic necessities such as generators, food, clean water, clothing and medicine.
Another impasse is the need to coordinate aid on the ground. “On the one hand, there is the government, the Moroccan state, which provided the army, companies like the phosphate company, transport trucks, ambulances, etc. On the other hand, there are the forces of the countries that have been authorized to contribute to the response,” explains Cardinal López Romero.
According to Islamic Relief’s the earthquake caused significant harm  to  Morocco’s  health  infrastructures  and  systems,  with  hospitals  and  clinics  unable  to  function  due  to structural  damage.
In the short terms, basic emergency services connected to search and rescue effort, and maternal healthcare are the most imminent sectoral needs.Urgent replenishment of blood stocks is required to meet the increasing needs of patients in critical condition.
In Taroudant Province, 60 paramedics are on the ground. Services provided include evacuation, first aid, transporting the wounded to the hospital, psychological support, reducing panic, organizing with the authorities and Supervision of food supplies, blankets, and tents shipped from the regional warehouse in Agadir.
The earthquake’s most extreme shake zone occurred in an area where residents are relatively lower wealth, and also occurred in a zone with limited access to hospitals and other health facilities . This has resulted in a significant strain on the health system, as the limited access to hospitals and health facilities has made it difficult for those affected by the earthquake to receive the medical attention they need.
According to reuters Some remote villages, like Tinmel, are in need of essential supplies, including tents, blankets, food, water, and medicine.
Damage and losses in the health sectors have further undermined access to basic health services from the affected population, especially in rural and mountains communities. Before the event, Morocco registered a persistent shortage of human resources, with only 7.2 doctors per 10,000 inhabitants on average, and maternal mortality rates that remained 2.5 times higher in rural areas than in urban areas, with neonatal mortality accounting for 75% of infant mortality.
According to CNN a makeshift field hospital has been set up near Asni, staffed with doctors and nurses to provide medical care to earthquake survivors.
The organization's local teams have traveled these days to Marrakech and the surrounding mountain villages to assess the urgent need for help. After an initial assessment of the situation, the local Cáritas has sent the first convoys with electric generators, first-need kits, blankets, clothing, first aid kits and medicines, and food. Cáritas Marrakech has also been in charge of finding accommodation for dozens of sub-Saharans who were left homeless after the destruction of the city.
Immediate attention is directed towards rescue efforts and clearing debris. Essential necessities such as water, food, and shelter are urgently needed for the victims. While healthcare, sanitation, and mental health support are widely required, there is a pressing demand for non-food items like blankets and warm clothing.
The earthquake severely impacted health infrastructures, especially in Al-Haouz and Marrakech, with many victims needing urgent care. Unsatisfactory burial conditions in remote villages raise disease outbreak concerns. Marrakech's outdoor treatments highlight the urgent need for logistical support, while PTSD emerges as a significant mental health issue.
Due to the scale of the disaster, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has launched an emergency appeal for a total of 100 million Swiss Francs after releasing one million Swiss France (1.04 million Euros) from its emergency fund to support the activities of the Moroccan Red Cross on the ground where the needs are multiple:Medical care, psychological support, health services, ensuring access to clean and safe water sources, provision of sanitation facilities, restoration of infrastructure, if necessary, distribution of essential hygiene-related supplies...
In a sign of the huge scale of the disaster, Morocco’s King Mohammed VI ordered the armed forces to mobilise air and land assets, specialised search-and-rescue teams, and a surgical field hospital.

A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit Morocco’s High Atlas mountain range on 8 September 2023, causing devastating loss of life and damage. As of 10 September, more than 2,000 people have been killed, with a further 2,421 people reported injured while search and rescue efforts continue. Government authorities are leading response efforts, with national response mechanisms and civil protection units deployed to provide critical assistance.
As the first to respond, affected people need focused, accurate information in their main language on how to stay safe and make critical decisions that impact their survival, coping, reunification and recovery. Early reports from Morocco indicate that people do not have enough information on how to access relief and shelter – with many resorting to sleeping in the streets. Research from other crises shows that people want actionable information from sources they trust. During a past crisis in Morocco, local NGOs, human rights organisations and local press correspondents were often cited as the main sources of trusted information.
Another impasse is the need to coordinate aid on the ground. “On the one hand, there is the government, the Moroccan state, which provided the army, companies like the phosphate company, transport trucks, ambulances, etc. On the other hand, there are the forces of the countries that have been authorized to contribute to the response,” explains Cardinal López Romero.

Moroccans prefer to consume information via television, especially older people and those living in rural areas. Most of the Moroccan population, even in rural areas, has access to a television, and 84% of households are also equipped with satellite dishes to access international programmes. There is an increasing reliance on social media for receiving breaking news, seen particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 36% of Moroccans indicating that they use social media as their primary source for breaking news. In 2021 the top social media sites by users in Morocco were: Facebook: 66%; YouTube: 25%; X (Twitter): 3%; and Instagram: 3%. More than 90% of internet users in Morocco used social media in 2019, with preference higher among younger people and those with higher levels of education. Internet penetration generally stands at 74%, with internet connectivity lower in rural and mountainous areas, such as the High Atlas mountains.
Despite the difficulties, Caritas Morocco continues to provide aid to the population in the town of Amizmiz, one of the areas most affected by the earthquake, and in some villages in the surrounding mountainous area. People are receiving basic necessities such as generators, food, clean water, clothing and medicine.
Another impasse is the need to coordinate aid on the ground. “On the one hand, there is the government, the Moroccan state, which provided the army, companies like the phosphate company, transport trucks, ambulances, etc. On the other hand, there are the forces of the countries that have been authorized to contribute to the response,” explains Cardinal López Romero.
The organization's local teams have traveled these days to Marrakech and the surrounding mountain villages to assess the urgent need for help. After an initial assessment of the situation, the local Cáritas has sent the first convoys with electric generators, first-need kits, blankets, clothing, first aid kits and medicines, and food. Cáritas Marrakech has also been in charge of finding accommodation for dozens of sub-Saharans who were left homeless after the destruction of the city.
The earthquake disrupted water networks, intensifying potable water shortages, especially in Al-Haouz and rural areas. The challenges are amplified with potential contamination risks. Urgent needs include clean water, sanitation facilities, hygiene kits, and infant care essentials, alongside tools like flashlights for power outages.
The Ministry of Equipment and Water confirmed, this evening, Wednesday, September 13, 2023, that as a result of the strong earthquake that our country experienced last Friday night, National Road No. 7, linking Tahanaout and Taroudant, is cut off to the passage of heavy vehicles and trucks at kilometer point No. 284 on the level of... Tamsult and Ait Youba districts, belonging to the Tzi-Nast community, in the Taroudant province.
The Ministry stated, in a statement, that the interruption of this road came as a result of the severe damage to the side of the road, which made it narrow and unable to allow this type of vehicle to cross.
Britain said it has deployed 60 search and rescue specialists, including four search dogs, rescue equipment and a medical assessment team to Morocco. Algeria, which severed diplomatic ties with Morocco in 2021 and closed its airspace to all planes registered in Morocco, said it would reopen its airspace for humanitarian aid and medical flights going to and from the Arab nation.
The public authorities are continuing their efforts to rescue and evacuate the wounded, take care of the injured victims, and open the roads damaged by the earthquake, mobilizing all necessary capabilities to address the effects of this painful tragedy.
Since Saturday, all necessary human resources and machinery, including bulldozers, logistical equipment and trucks, have been deployed towards the areas affected by the earthquake in this region in order to ensure the smooth flow of road traffic and speed up the delivery of aid to the affected areas.
The regional official highlighted that work is underway in full swing and continuously in order to facilitate the movement of aid through these roads, pointing out that soil erosion and falling rock blocks have made the task difficult, as each time the road is forced to reopen.
The tireless efforts made by the various authorities since the Al Haouz earthquake have borne fruit, with the reopening of the road leading to Ighil, the area worst hit by this natural disaster, facilitating the delivery of aid to the stricken population. The road to Ighil is crucial for transporting various forms of aid to the affected populations, initially by air, using Royal Armed Forces (FAR) helicopters due to the area's inaccessibility by land.
In the early hours following the earthquake, significant human and logistical resources were mobilized in the province of Al Haouz to reopen to traffic all the sections of road that had been closed due to landslides and rockfalls in this difficult-to-access mountainous area, which severely hampered the arrival of aid and rescue teams to the areas affected by the earthquake, particularly the Ighil region.
The Provincial Director of Equipment, Transport and Logistics, Hicham Frindi, told MAP that the commune of Ighil and the surrounding villages are now accessible and opened up.
To this end, he said, the Ministry had mobilized some 60 machines in the Al Haouz province, as well as considerable human resources, including managers, technicians and machine drivers. A program had also been drawn up in coordination with the provincial authorities to intervene on the rural tracks belonging to the communes, and the necessary machines mobilized.
Frindi explained that the work carried out by the Ministry's teams had enabled the reopening of the No.7 national road linking Tahanaout to Taroudant, as well as the Provincial Road  2036 on the Azekour-Anemerou and RP 2007-Ighil sections. He noted that PR 2017 between Marrakech and Oukaimden had been reopened over 15 km, PR 2030 between Aghbalou and Oukaimden over 30 km, PR 2015 between Asni and Imlil over 15 km, PR 2009 between Amezmiz and Adassil over 37 km, and PR 2024 between Moulay Brahim and Asni over 4 km.
Network connectivity in the most affected rural areas remains very sparse, Therefore population numbers in these areas measured through mobile applications should be considered of very limited representativeness. in the areas measured through mobile applications should be considered of very limited representativeness. in the cites, however, facebooks user base is relatively high, with users with location services measuring between 10% and 20% or the total population. This is consistent with public estimates of the facebook user base in Morocco as being between 55% and 60%.
Human Appeal with its local partner has identified the most urgent immediate needs being shelter, food Packs, lighting, blankets, clothing, cooking tools including cooking gas and non-food items. The initial humanitarian intervention being deployed by Human Appeal will cover aid valued at US$ 250 thousand.
Sources from the site confirmed that the Jemaa Lefna Square and the Old Medina witnessed, during the last hours, the influx of significant numbers of tourists, at a time when reports indicated that the number of reservations was not affected by the earthquake tragedy, except for the first two days after the accident. The same applies to flights, which in turn maintained. At its usual pace, which indicates the return of life to the Palm Capital, a favorite destination for tourists, including the most famous international figures.
The construction techniques must be appropriate for the geographic features of these spots. The expert added that in the event of difficulties or calamities, “these areas should be equipped for the possibility of communication with the rest of the national territory.”

Local sources reported that the floods caused material losses in some fields, destroyed some fruitful fields, and also swept away a car on the road between Midelt and Al-Rish.
In the most affected areas located near the epicenter of the earthquake, a real economic and social disruption was observed in a territorial context where the main livelihood traditionally revolves around agriculture and livestock.
Before the severe test of the agricultural sector and the livestock sector in the province of Al-Haouz through the damage and destruction linked to the recent earthquake, the agonies of drought were already raging in the region

People are receiving basic necessities such as generators, food, clean water, clothing and medicine.
The government has traditionally coped with water scarcity through dams and irrigation investments, but the latest drought has coincided with historically low water reserves, severely reducing water availability for irrigation.
According to reuters Some remote villages, like Tinmel, are in need of essential supplies, including tents, blankets, food, water, and medicine.
Access to safe drinking water and safe and adequate sanitation facilities are a priority need for rural and remote communities as well as for internal displacement hotspots.
Lack of access and demographic pressure on existing services may lead to harmful WASH practices, exposing affected population to water-borned diseases and epidemics.
According to CNN Many villages, including Asni, have been severely affected, with residents facing challenges like collapsed buildings, lack of water, and disrupted daily life. According to Acaps There is also a severe shortage of clean water, aggravated by the pre-existing lack of potable water in al-Haouz
Immediate attention is directed towards rescue efforts and clearing debris. Essential necessities such as water, food, and shelter are urgently needed for the victims. While healthcare, sanitation, and mental health support are widely required, there is a pressing demand for non-food items like blankets and warm clothing.
The earthquake devastated Al Haouz, Taroudant, Marrakech-Safi, and Chichaoua, causing massive displacements, especially in clay-built villages. Traditional mud houses were severely damaged, leaving many homeless. Urgent aid is needed, particularly tents, blankets, and warm clothing, especially in mountainous areas like Tinmel and Ouarzazate
The earthquake disrupted water networks, intensifying potable water shortages, especially in Al-Haouz and rural areas. The challenges are amplified with potential contamination risks. Urgent needs include clean water, sanitation facilities, hygiene kits, and infant care essentials, alongside tools like flashlights for power outages.
Due to the scale of the disaster, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has launched an emergency appeal for a total of 100 million Swiss Francs after releasing one million Swiss France (1.04 million Euros) from its emergency fund to support the activities of the Moroccan Red Cross on the ground where the needs are multiple:Medical care, psychological support, health services, ensuring access to clean and safe water sources, provision of sanitation facilities, restoration of infrastructure, if necessary, distribution of essential hygiene-related supplies...
Residents in Tinmel, a remote village close to the epicentre where 15 people were killed, said they had been sharing food, water and medicine, but desperately needed tents and blankets to shelter from the cold mountain nights.
Humanitarian needs in the affected provinces persist, with food, clean water, psychosocial support, shelter, and blankets being reported as priority needs (ACAPS 10/09/2023; Action for Humanity 13/09/2023). Across all affected areas, the earthquake has affected about 100,000 children, who likely need protection assistance (UNICEF 11/09/2023). It has damaged over 500 schools, affecting Chichaoua and Taroudant provinces the most (Action for Humanity 13/09/2023).
CARE Morocco, which already has a presence in the earthquake-affected areas, is starting a relief operation in support of the Moroccan authorities, focusing on hot meals, safe water supply, and emergency shelter, with particular attention given to women, girls, and people with disabilities. It is also preparing a psychosocial response given the huge mental health impact of the disaster.
Many people in devastated villages are reporting a lack of vital supplies, including of food, water and shelter.
The army said it was reinforcing search-and-rescue teams, providing drinking water, and distributing food, tents and blankets.
Residents of the isolated villages high in the peaks of the Atlas mountains were dependent on aid deliveries for water and basic food, he said, a situation made more complicated by the loss of electricity resources and ongoing issues with telephone networks. “Anyone that had any remaining phone battery left used it to demand help,” Saadoune said. [Omar Saadoune, a civil society activist, speaking from Casablanca]
On the other hand, some of the families affected by the earthquake were accommodated in a designated place for shelter prepared for them by the Marrakesh authorities. Some of the families benefiting from this shelter expressed their thanks and gratitude to the authorities for providing all appropriate conditions in the place, whether in terms of accommodation, food, drink, and even medicine.
The IFRC works in Morocco through the Moroccan Red Crescent, coordinated with local authorities, and which has teams deployed on the ground in the most affected provinces such as Haouz, Taroudant, Marrakech or Chichawa. The Red Crescent is already distributing tents, food and drinking water to the affected population. In addition, it provides psychological support and transportation to injured people and runs a blood bank.
Since the disaster hit on Friday night, Moroccan Red Crescent teams have been working with Moroccan authorities. They are supporting search and rescue operations, providing first aid and psychosocial support, helping transport the injured to hospitals and evacuating people from damaged buildings, and providing food and water.
In many villages there is also currently no water because pipes have been damaged. The poorest people are affected most of all, as in the villages their homes are generally made of mud.
People urgently need food, tents and hygiene materials.
“We are seeking 100 million Swiss francs ($112 million) so that we can meet the most urgent needs at this time, which include health, water, sanitation, hygiene and materials,” said Caroline Holt, Director of the Disaster, Climate and Crisis Division at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Relief in the field of shelter and basic needs.”She added that funds are needed for “health, water, sanitation, hygiene, relief materials, shelter and basic needs.” “We need to make sure we avoid a second wave of disasters,” she added.
Government officials are taking the lead in responding to the crisis and providing crucial aid and assistance to those affected by this tragic event. The primary reported needs are food, water, psychosocial support, and shelter. Due to the extensive damage caused by the earthquake, many people have been displaced from their homes and are seeking refuge in public facilities, often resorting to sleeping outdoors.
Recognizing the significance of maintaining proper hygiene, AFH has also distributed 100 hygiene kits to those in need. These kits contain essential items that promote cleanliness and sanitation, contributing to the overall well-being of the affected individuals and communities. Furthering their commitment to providing essential relief, the organization has distributed 100 blankets. These blankets serve a crucial role in helping individuals stay warm and comfortable, especially during challenging conditions.","The earthquake in Morocco has caused significant devastation and has resulted in urgent humanitarian needs.
